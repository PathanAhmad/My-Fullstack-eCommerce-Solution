Current Status
I am currently undertaking a complete rebuild of the project from scratch. This decision reflects my dedication to creating an authentic and high-quality solution. I chose to redo the work personally rather than relying on previous code or external sources. This approach ensures that I apply my learning and adhere to best practices, avoiding shortcuts and maintaining genuine development integrity. While this has extended the timeline, it is a testament to my commitment to producing a robust and reliable application.

Features I'm still working on:

~~1. User Authentication~~

~~Backend Authentication: To be implemented from scratch using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for enhanced security.~~

~~Frontend Authentication: Redesigning the user authentication flow for a better user experience.~~

2. Checkout Process

Building a comprehensive checkout process that includes shipping information, payment gateway integration, and order summary.

3. Admin Functionality

Developing an admin dashboard to efficiently manage customers, products, and orders.

4. Product Reviews

Adding functionality for users to leave reviews and ratings for products.

5. Search Functionality

Implementing an advanced search system to enable users to find products quickly and accurately.
